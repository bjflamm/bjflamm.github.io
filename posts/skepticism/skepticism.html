            Like most, I regularly come across people that believe they have the answers. Not necessarily to everything, but to the big questions that deal with controversial topics like religion, the conflict in Israel, border security, racial inequality, climate change, etc. 

            <br /><br />

            These people will be the first to preface their arguments with “as a history major...” or a similar phrase that instantly makes me question their every word. They might even quote their knowledge of a credible philosopher or two, claim they only read academic journals while secretly consuming a daily dose of mainstream news, but the majority only refer to a couple sources for perspective (or worse, a single book). On top of that, these sources are usually the outlets that cater to desirable viewpoints - for example, if you’re a conservative you’ll go to Fox News and disregard most other channels as biased. 

            <br /><br />

            But the other side is just as guilty. I’ve recently become interested in how those around me at university are among the brightest in the world yet so darkened by an equally ridiculous liberal agenda. Conservatism sways to the right out of fear while liberalism sways to the left out of a learned and unequivocal righteousness, but under scrutiny, both resemble each other more and more. 

            <br /><br />

            In all honesty, I’ve taken part in liberalism to an extent. I used to return to south Georgia and denounce the countryside with all of its Trump paraphernalia and confederate flags as uneducated, imbecilic, racist, xenophobic, but never stopped to ask myself why I felt this way. 

            <br /><br />

            There are so many people that I love and respect in the south, so why did I generalize this slander to the entire population that helped raise me? 

            <br /><br />

            Nine times out of ten, they were never original thoughts that I could derive from my own experience and were instead regurgitations of the experiences of others. 

            <br /><br />

            After this realization, I’ve come to the belief that my false sense of certainty was actually a façade that was reinforced by the echo chamber I had willingly lived in for years. 

            <br /><br />

            As we all know, being agreeable has always been much easier than standing up for what you truly believe in. What an undertaking it is to argue your individualized truth to someone that already has their own. 

            <br /><br />

            I’m not here to convince anybody of specific answers to those tough issues I mentioned. Just like in my past articles, I take the stance that there is no ultimate truth but everybody has their own path to a truth; however, I do have a goal for this piece.

            <br /><br />

            Above all else, don’t mistake me here - you as an individual are valuable and your voice deserves to be heard, but only when rooted in fact and not feeling. 

            <br /><br />

            Take, for example, the feeling that south Georgia isn’t anti-Semitic or rampant with inequality. 

            <br /><br />

            As home to the smallest active congregation in the U.S., Beth Israel will have around ten people on any given Friday night. It’s a small and vibrant community with a rich heritage, but it could be bigger. I never really thought about it while growing up, but after a conversation with a Jewish couple who has been in Vidalia all of their lives, I realized there had to be many more Jews in the Sweet Onion City. Unfortunately, this couple had seen Jewish doctors reject their identity because they feared it would hurt their practices in a predominantly Christian town. 

            <br /><br />

            Just because anti-Semitic hate crimes don’t occur doesn’t mean anti-Semitism doesn’t exist, just like how segregation isn’t legal but neighborhoods and public schools haven’t changed much since 1954 (Brown v. Board of Education). 

            <br /><br />

            As another example, my most recent experience with the bigotry of the liberal agenda stems from conversations with a friend of mine at university who seems to wholeheartedly support Palestine. 

            <br /><br />

            But before I get into this let me preface by saying the conflict in the Middle East is one that I don’t usually argue on because of its complexity, but no matter their stance I will always pick a fight with those who are certain about a solution. 

            <br /><br />

            This is because I’ve learned so much about the relationship of Middle Eastern countries in the past few years. 

            <br /><br />

            And the more I’ve learned, the more I realized how complex and tangled the conflict is. 

            <br /><br />

            Even more importantly, how misconstrued it is because of the media. 

            <br /><br />

            I recently traveled to Washington, D.C., where I had a Lyft driver who was a reporter in Iran and fled the country a long time ago. I could hear in his voice how much he not only misses his country, but how much love he still has for Iran. I asked him about his favorite places to visit there, what he misses most, and, of course, his favorite food at home. You know, all the easy questions that he answered in between laughs and momentary reminiscing; however, because it’s such a touchy subject, it took me awhile to muster up the courage to ask him the hard one.

            <br /><br /> 

            "How do Iranians feel about Israel?", I asked. 

            <br /><br />

            He laughed.

            <br /><br />

            “Here we go”, I thought. 

            <br /><br />

            But it was here where I experienced a moment with a person whom I’ll never forget. 

            <br /><br />

            “In Iran, contrary to what everyone thinks, we love Americans and we love Israelis”, he said, “it’s the government that causes all of the problems.”

            <br /><br />

            I’m sure this doesn’t cover the perspective of every Iranian just as in the same way the average American tends towards xenophobia, but to have an Iranian man tell me, a Jew, that we’re brothers; it left me speechless. The media seems to focus on the negativity in hopes of attracting more viewers; consequently, the world is conveyed as being worse than it really is. 

            <br /><br />

            With that being said, how can people like my friend at university, who have no attachment to Israel or Palestine (or the Middle East for that matter),

            <br /><br />

            or those who have only accidentally driven through an impoverished neighborhood with their doors locked,

            <br /><br />

            or those that have never seen a poorly-rated and underfunded public school,

            <br /><br />

            how can you feel so certain that you have the answer?

            <br /><br />

            Just as the stereotypical conservative is viewed as someone who has never left their county except to take their children to Disney, the cookiecutter liberal has been spoonfed equality and self-righteousness without ever leaving the safety of the think tank of their community which has been emboldened by idealists who have no grip on the reality of the situation.

            <br /><br />

            So when arguing with this type of person, I tell them to do exactly what they’ve never done. 

            <br /><br />

            See it for yourself. 

            <br /><br />

            Go to Israel, go to Palestine, and go to the surrounding Arab countries, talk with people from both sides, but don’t go looking for the answers you want. Hear every side that has emerged from this conflict that has been around for much longer than the modern world. 

            <br /><br />

            For those that can’t make the trip, focus on tangible problems - we have more than enough to keep you busy within the borders. 

            <br /><br />

            Invest your time and effort into people instead of just throwing money at a broken system and feeling good about yourself. See for yourself how many of the homeless are at the mercy of a vicious cycle of dead ends put in place by those who promised to help. 

            <br /><br />

            Figure out how you can get involved in a community that seems to have been forgotten by rest of the world until the government deems it gentrifiable. See for yourself how long a dollar stays in the African-American community before it crosses back into a white businessman’s hand. Even though Atlanta prides itself on how much it has been influenced by black culture, its residents have decided to take all of the entertainment and history while refusing to acknowledge what it signifies. 

            <br /><br />

            After doing this, maybe we’ll realize how blissfully ignorant we really are to these issues. 

            <br /><br />
