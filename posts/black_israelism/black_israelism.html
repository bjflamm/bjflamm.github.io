            Lately, I’ve been having a significant amount of encounters with Black Israelites who also identify as Black Hebrews. All of these encounters have ranged from hilarious to extremely unpleasant albeit entertaining. For those that aren’t familiar with the Black Israelite movement, it’s essentially the African-American counterpart to the alt-right movement we see rearing its ugly head in the US. However, as with any article that derives from personal experience, I have to preface that my interactions have been somewhat limited. I’m sure a movement as large as this will also have a conservative following - it’s just unfortunate that the extremists are the loudest ones no matter what religion they advocate. 
            <br /><br />
            So, let’s begin with a little history. 
            <br /><br />
            The roots of Black Israelism trace back to the centuries of slavery in the US. Identifying with the Hebrew bondage in Egypt, slaves would sing religious songs that were so obviously influenced by the Christianity around them. It wasn’t until the end of the Jim Crow era that the movement gained the traction we can see today when a man by the name of Ben Ammi received a vision from an angel saying that all African-Americans were descendants of the lost tribe of Judah and it was time to return to their promised land of Israel. [1] 
            <br /><br />
            From my perspective, this is where the movement already breaks down. As I’ve mentioned in a previous post, nothing good has come out of someone getting a vision from a higher power. David Koresh, Jan Matthyas, Joseph Smith, Jesus of Nazareth, L. Ron Hubbard… the list goes on and, of course, some are worse than others. What sort of god would give the capital ‘t’ Truth to one man? 
            <br /><br />
            Whether it’s a person receiving a vision, falsified history, a supremacist belief, or secrecy that results in the exclusion of others, the parallels between the cults of the world are uncanny and Black Israelism is no different. 
            <br /><br />
            I was walking through downtown Dallas when I heard a group screaming scripture over a megaphone. I used to expect the Westboro crowd, but after seeing the how Black Israelites have infested Facebook feeds I wasn’t that surprised to see black men covered in chanukiahs and Stars of David like the one I wear around my neck. I had seen them just a few weeks before in California where they were out on Venice Beach screaming at white people and recruiting people of color. This time, though, I actually went over to the street corner. It was the usual setup:  posters depicting a black Jesus, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, and images of slaves being sold. One guy preaching over the megaphone unless he designates his assistant to scream verses at onlookers. A few people from the group on the sidewalk handing out pamphlets. I talked to a pamphlet worker first:
            <br /><br />
            Me: “Hey so is this Hebrew Israelism? What are y’all?”
            <br /><br />
            Worker: “We’re not a religion, we just believe in the bible. Where are you from?”
            <br /><br />
            Me: “I was born here, but I’m Jewish so I’m interested in what you have to say.”
            <br /><br />
            Worker: “But where are your parents from?”
            <br /><br />
            Me: “They’re also from here.”
            <br /><br />
            Worker: *Stops talking to me and looks for other people to hand a pamphlet to*
            <br /><br />
            Me: “Can I have one of those pamphlets?”
            <br /><br />
            Worker: “It’s only for Hispanics.”
            <br /><br />
            Me: “No problem, I can read Spanish.”
            <br /><br />
            Worker: “No, it’s only for Hispanic people.”
            <br /><br />
            There’s the secrecy I mentioned. Needless to say I became a little frustrated with this brick wall of a conversation. I looked at one of the signs at the setup and it looked a lot like this:
            <br /><br />
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                     <img src="../images/tribes_of_black_israel.jpg" align="middle" height="650" width="650"></p>[2]
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            Me: “So where did you get the mappings of the tribes of Israel to the people of today?”
            <br /><br />
            Worker: “The bible.”
            <br /><br />
            Quickly realizing the futility of trying to get anything out of this schmuck, I turned back around to listen to the main speaker. He eventually began to acknowledge me once all the black and hispanic people left and I was still standing there reading the propaganda while looking up the context of what they were saying. He asked for my name and if I identified with any of the tribes on that list. I gave him the same answer as the other guy but, as any Jew will say, nobody knows their tribe. I also jokingly said that there are both black and white people hate me for who I am even though I haven’t done anything wrong, so I must be doing something right. He went on to correct me by saying the Israelites would be a cursed people and so we can know who is the real chosen people of “Yahweh” by the curses.
            <br /><br />
            Stop right there. 
            <br /><br />
            His flawed belief that Yahweh is a Hebrew word is one point of discussion, but more importantly this belief that curses will define the people of Israel is where my Jewish people and the Black Israelites differ. 
            <br /><br />
            There’s a scene in The Office where Michael makes everyone act as another race for “Diversity Day”. Stanley ironically gets the black notecard and Pam gets the Jewish card. They begin talking to each other and Michael walks up and says, “Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.” 
            <br /><br />
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                     <img src="../images/olymp_of_suff.png" align="middle" height="650" width="650"></p>[3]
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            If you’re a sensible human, you can admit that both races have seen a great amount of persecution over the centuries. Going a step further, a sensible person will not try to compare the two and figure out who’s been more oppressed. We as Jews (and normal African-Americans) have never tried to rub our suffering into other’s faces, much less push a religious agenda founded in suffering. Going back to my hypotheticals that I love so much, what kind of god would choose a people based on how much they suffer? I don’t care what religious texts you have up your sleeve - the only thing being confirmed by believing in this is your god is all-powerful and has a really disgusting, dark side to him. 
            <br /><br />
            But what got me the most, and what I’ve read more atrocious examples of is the fact that this Black Israelite is invalidating everything my people have gone through and continue to go through. For example, an article from a few years ago discusses an exchange in Philadelphia between a Black Israelite and a Jewish college student:
            <br /><br />
            "I'm talking about 99 million n*****s! You talking about 6 million crackers?"
            <br /><br />
            "Are you saying the Holocaust is a joke?" the Jewish man asks. 
            <br /><br />
            "It's a joke!" the "general" responds. "The Holocaust is a damn joke! Heil Hitler!" [4]
             <br /><br />
            Let that sink in for a little bit. 
            <br /><br />
            Getting back to the Black Israelite speaker discussing how he knows he is of the tribe of Judah, I had to ask why on earth my people would claim to be Jewish if we really weren’t at some point. 
            <br /><br />
            He pointed me to this verse in the Christian New Testament:
            <br /><br />
            <i>“I know your works, tribulations and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan”</i> [5]
            <br /><br />
            Basically, we’re all evil. I’m talking Jews, Muslims, whites, asians. Anybody who’s not of the tribes above is a descendant of the mysterious satan figure who strangely begins to pop up in Christian literature. 
            <br /><br />
            Makes sense right? 
            <br /><br />
            Not only is it so much easier to navigate life as a non-Jew, but at what point do you get off by saying that whites appropriated this Israelite culture? If they’re correct in saying that whites conquered the true (Black) Israelites, why would we adopt their practices that allowed us to conquer them in the first place? If you look at the Jewish Bible, there are so many examples of the Jews being conquered and assimilating to the culture of their captors. Outside of Judaism, it’s the same thing as African slaves assimilating to the Christian culture of the slave owners. Nature points to survival of the fittest and we would’ve imposed our beliefs on them. 
            <br /><br />
            Either way, my people still have the history, the language, the culture, but when asked if Black Israelites speak Hebrew or for other specifics all I got back was hate. We have proof that Jewish communities have never fully left Israel and even modern genetic testing will point any Jews lineage back to the Middle East. So, there’s not much in favor of Black Israelism minus a few verses taken out of context. 
            <br /><br />
            To address another difference between Black Israelism and Judaism, we as Jews believe everyone has a path regardless of their race and even religious beliefs whereas in Black Israelism there’s a message of racial superiority underlying the message of love of their savior Jesus. You could be the worst person the planet has ever seen, but everything’s cool if you’re of the tribes. 
            <br /><br />
            God forbid you’re a Jew like me who is part of the hidden organization with the goal of world domination through controlling the governments and banking systems of today. 
            <br /><br />
            Taking a step back from the religious discussion, black Israelites may or may not be descendants of Israel by some off chance… but who cares. 
            <br /><br />
            I was recently asked by a friend if I thought the world was getting better. We’re more aware of the world’s suffering today which has mobilized people of every background to help. Racism is finally at the forefront of conversation and cultures have become more accepting of every lifestyle - although some slower than others (I’m looking at you south Georgia). Diversity is on everybody’s mind whether about skin color or just diversity of thought. I didn’t answer my friend at the time, but I would say yes. 
            <br /><br />
            I truly believe we’re progressing as humanity and there’s no room for this type of racist ideology. 
            <br /><br />
            To anybody reading this that is a person of color, my plea is to not fall for this message of hatred. In my experience as a Jewish person, the most powerful thing you can do is to remember where you came from and use it to guide where you’re going. We eat bitter herbs during Passover to not only remind us of our own enslavement in Egypt but to continue fighting against modern slavery and oppression that is still rampant today. 
            <br /><br />
            I speak for every single Jew when I say we love y’all.
            <br /><br />
            But more important than the words I say, when you’re faced with racism and oppression and inequality.
            <br /><br />
            We’ll be the first to your side. 
            <br /><br />
