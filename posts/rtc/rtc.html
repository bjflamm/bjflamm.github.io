            <p> I can't lie - it feels strange to be writing this years after my trips to Jackson Hole and Myrtle Beach. If someone were to ask me back in 2014 where I thought I'd be at 23, it wouldn't be here; nowhere close to here. As I’m sure the honest answer for anyone asked the “where do you see yourself in five years question” is unimaginable. For those Christians who know me and those that were on Summer Project or Summer Discipleship Project with me, I hope my words not only reveal what caused me to leave the religion but also challenge you in your own faith. For everyone else, my name is Benjamin and I’m a Jew who used to devoutly practice Christianity. 
            <br /> <br />
            My experiences began when I moved from back to my hometown of Vidalia, Georgia, in 2007. I was just starting the seventh grade as well as the unforgiving puberty years. I had no solid group of friends and was bullied by both classmates and teachers. Looking for some form of acceptance when I wasn’t escaping reality in a book, I ended up attending Tabernacle Baptist Church. I found exactly what I was looking for there, but why wouldn’t I? I was young, fresh, and moldable and Christianity feeds off of this. I did the normal bible belt Christian life:  attending sunday school, services, vacation bible school in the summer, youth group. This went on for not even a year because I transferred to the local private Christian school. The summer between 7th and 8th grade provided me some time to grow and allow my body to catch up with my athleticism. It also introduced me to some the greatest friends who I have to thank for who and where I am today. Both religious and not, it’s there in that friend group that could convince any person that perfect love exists outside of whatever religion humanity can conjure up. Even in the Christian atmosphere of the private school, I completely and ironically lost whatever need I felt for a god to be in control of my life. I started playing sports, getting attention from girls, and found exactly what I was searching for just the year prior in the acceptance I received from those around me. I lost my need and, in turn, began to develop my own individuality that had been postponed due to the expectations of a Fordian-style assembly line turned Christian church community. A huge byproduct of going to school in a Christian environment in a predominantly Christian town is the homogeneity that strips the personality and wanderlust from anybody within reach, but the mandatory chapel services in the morning didn’t help either. This, of course, all depends on what type of homogeneity is nearby. For my hometown, it’s close mindedness topped off with the fear of the unknown. Close mindedness that is only learned from centuries of racism and xenophobia that has recently begun to show its ugly face again. For the average Christian that I encounter, it’s the fear of the unknown. Sure, most will ask the tough questions like “what does God want for my life?” and the cultish personal favorite “does the life I’m living now merit eternal life?”, but many refuse to try understanding the foundations of the religion for which they have sacrificed everything. I was one of those people - exposed to Christianity at a young age and afraid to doubt something that seemed so ominous and certain.
