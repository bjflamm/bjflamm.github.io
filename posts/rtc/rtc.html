            <p> I can't lie; it feels strange to be writing this years after my trips to Jackson Hole and Myrtle Beach. If someone were to ask me back in 2014 where I thought I'd be at 23, it wouldn't be here; nowhere close to here. As I’m sure the honest answer for anyone asked the “where do you see yourself in five years question” is unimaginable. I want to preface this article by saying that this is not something that happened overnight and I, like most, struggled and continue to struggle through questions for which answers may not exist. Many people referred to in this article I still hold a mountain of respect for and cherish my acquaintance with them. Most of this work is actually a hybrid of my Christian testimony with the obvious twists of Judaism to which I now subscribe. For those Christians who know me and those that were on Summer Project or Summer Discipleship Project with me, I hope my words not only reveal what caused me to leave the faith but also challenge you in your own faith. For everyone else, my name is Benjamin and I’m a Jew who used to devoutly practice Christianity. 
            <br /><br />
            My experiences began when I moved back to my hometown of Vidalia, Georgia, in 2007 after a two-year stint in Tampa. I was just starting the seventh grade as well as unforgiving puberty years. I had no solid group of friends and was bullied by both classmates and teachers. Looking for some form of acceptance when I wasn’t escaping reality in a book, I ended up attending Tabernacle Baptist Church. I found exactly what I was looking for there, but why wouldn’t I? I was young, fresh, and moldable and Christianity feeds off of this. I prayed the prayer and then did the normal bible belt Christian life:  attending sunday school, services, vacation bible school in the summer, youth group. 
            <br /><br />
            This went on for not even a year because I transferred to the local private Christian school. Even in the Christian atmosphere of the school, I completely and ironically lost whatever need I felt for a god to be in control of my life. The summer between 7th and 8th grade provided me some time to grow and allow my body to catch up with my athleticism. It also introduced me to some the greatest friends who I have to thank for who and where I am today. Both religious and not, it’s there in that friend group that could convince any person that perfect love exists outside of whatever faith humanity can conjure up. I started playing sports, getting attention from girls, and found exactly what I was searching for just the year prior in the acceptance I received from those around me. I lost my need and, in turn, began to develop my own individuality that had been postponed due to the expectations of a Fordian-style assembly line turned Christian church community. 
            <br /><br />
            A huge byproduct of going to school in a Christian environment in a predominantly religious town is the homogeneity that strips the personality and wanderlust from anybody within reach, but the mandatory chapel services in the morning didn’t help either. This, of course, all depends on what type of homogeneity is nearby. For my hometown, it’s this repressive close-mindedness. Close-mindedness that is only learned from centuries of racism and xenophobia that has begun to show its ugly face again. For every Christian that I encounter, no matter the upbringing, it’s the fear of the unknown. Sure, most will ask the tough questions like “what does God want for my life?” and the cultish personal favorite “does the life I’m living now merit eternal life?”, but many refuse to try understanding the foundations of the faith for which they have sacrificed everything. I was one of those people - exposed to Christianity at a young age and afraid to doubt something that seemed so ominous and certain.
            <br /><br />
            Not much time passed before I found myself back in church at Vidalia First United Methodist. I was still the same teenager with no desire to connect with a god but definitely intrigued with why so many of those around me did. Though the primary reason for me going back was my interest in a girl with whom I later dated and found myself in a pseudo-Christian long term relationship. I would constantly ask her about why she believed what she did and it always came back to that godforsaken answer of faith that people give when they don’t know. I used to make my ex uncomfortable by not singing at services by giving her the explanation that I want to know what I’m singing about before I start repeating these words off the projector screen. I even one time told a youth leader at the church that “I felt more Jewish than anything, why should I believe in this Jesus guy?” His response was similar:  “what have you got to lose? If I’m wrong, I’ve wasted this life then nothing happens, but if you’re wrong, you’ve wasted eternity.” 
            <br /><br />
            I fell for it, too. 
            <br /><br />
            It’s a horrifying thought for a teenager to hear, but it’s more frightening now as a 23 year-old to realize that there’s a powerful faith with a following that believes the only way to avoid spending eternity in a fictional hell that’s been embellished for centuries with the most repulsive ideas that religious men could come up with is to have faith in a charismatic Jewish man who saw an opening for a possible revolution against Rome and consequently paid the ultimate price. 
            <br /><br />
            Even after all of this prying with no concrete answers, I later came to practice this faith that has a long track record of being violent towards my people. It started when an old friend gave me a book authored by Kyle Idleman, <i>Not A Fan</i>. I once again fell for one of the primary tools of Christian evangelism - relatability. In his book, Idleman speaks of the conversion of Saul who is better known as the Apostle Paul. As the Christian tale goes, Saul was a Jew among Jews who had everything a man could want. He was supposedly studying under the top teachers of the torah and was a self-proclaimed Pharisee, but Jesus appeared to Saul on the road to Damascus  where he was heading to persecute the early church that had fled Jerusalem. 
            <br /><br />
            I never had a specific moment where I felt myself get fuzzy or and other weird and mystical stuff that people say happens, but I did relate to Saul over the next few weeks. What sort of Jew leaves a perfect life to later be martyred if he didn’t have some firsthand experience that made him flip sides? I thought on all of my accomplishments in high school, my social status, where I found my value. Maybe I was missing something if this 1st century Jew gave up everything for what seemed like a good cause. I couldn’t have cared less about the details; all I cared about was that there was this apparently outstanding Jewish man who at one moment was killing followers of Christianity and then the next he became the most influential apostle in the faith’s history. It never crossed my mind to ask where Saul came from so I left myself to only rely on human nature which, as we know, in itself is entirely unpredictable. At that point in my life, all of the things I was striving for seemed fleeting and I decided to give Christianity a real chance.
            <br /><br />
            I moved into my dorm at Georgia Tech just a couple weeks later and immediately became involved in Campus Crusade (Cru) through a close friend. I constantly attended bible studies and other organized events, but it didn’t take long before I started shying away from the leadership of the campus ministry. Cru has denounced some other ministries as cults, such as Alpha Omega where they prowl campuses to bring unsuspecting students to their North River Church of Christ building and tell you to leave your friends and current life in order to be “born again”; however, Cru also showed some signs of brainwash. Once I was an established member, I began having meetings with the head of campus outreach. These meetings started off normal, but then came the time to sign up for summer project. The head of campus outreach asked me where I wanted to be a year from now, once again unimaginable, and then proceeded to draw a graph with the x-axis being time and the y-axis being spirituality. Of course I wanted to be on the upswing on my faith, but Jesus Christ, the way it was sold to me made me uncomfortable at the time even as a believer. 
            <br /><br />
            I ended up going on the project and it was fine. It was summer camp in Jackson Hole with an awkward attempt at evangelizing the mormon-runaway infested town of Jackson. It was here where the aforementioned girl from the methodist church and I began to talk about marriage just a month before she started dating some other Christian guy - something I have learned to be common among the community as long as God tells you it’s what he wants. It’s also here that I met a great friend and one of the realest people still in my life today. He also quit Christianity after similar festering circumstances:  people who garner distrust and a multitude of questions that lead to trying to untangle the beautiful but ill-connected fabrication of one of the world’s great religions. He’s been a constant reminder to check my values and to never become content with the <i>I don’t know’s</i> of life. 
            <br /><br />
            That, of course, is something that only time can teach after years of shedding the woolen beliefs of Christianity and finding that skeptics like myself aren’t wolves but catalysts for improving the human condition.
