            I have to start this off by thanking my mensch of a rabbi, Mark Zimmerman. He was ready to welcome me back to the family and teach me before I even told him why I was there. Also to Birthright Bus 286 for helping foster my identity and individuality as a Jew. Thank you all for your wisdom in guiding me through the Jewish history and how my life plays a role in it each day. 
            <br /><br />

            </p>

            <br /><br />
            If you read my previous post, I hope the first thing you wondered about was why I chose Judaism. It’s not everyday you hear about someone choosing to join a people who have been persecuted, murdered, and almost comically deemed the descendants of Satan (see Revelation 3:9). Thanks John, I’m sure the Catholics canonized you for that one. 
            <br /><br />
            You would think it necessary to apologize in advance for preaching my beliefs to the choir of those who are Jewish or familiar with Judaism as I’m writing this under the assumption that non-Jews are the primary readers, but one aspect of Judaism I’d like to highlight is best represented by the saying <i>ask two Jews, get three opinions</i>. I’m a Conservative Jew and within conservatism branches millions of Jewish perspectives and none of them make you any more or less of a Jew. As Rabbi Susan Grossman elaborates on the saying: “It is this openness and concurrent tendency against dogma, which is responsible for creating the kind of cultural environment that stimulates creative thinking”. [1]
            <br /><br />
            However, there is one perspective that doesn’t disqualify Jewishness but will estrange even the most well-versed Jew. Coming from Christianity, it had to be the first thing I directed my attention towards - the belief that Jesus the Nazarene fulfilled all of the prophecies and therefore was the promised messiah.
            <br /><br />
            It’s futile to step through every one of the hundreds of messianic prophecies and pick the ones that were fulfilled and those that weren’t. If someone completed 349 of them right down to the dot but left only one unanswered then, in Jewish thought, they’re considered a failed messiah. To me, I’m indifferent with the number game. I take the realist approach and say it’s pretty clear-cut that the messiah is supposed to come as a powerful and divinely-chosen <b>person</b> who ushers in the era of world peace. Maybe the early Christians saw a glimpse of that through all of their persecution and martyrdom, but the thing that really gets me is what the Roman centurion at Golgotha said once he saw Jesus take his last breath on the cross:  “Truly this was the Son of God”. 
            <br /><br />
            Did he see world peace come flying down from the heavens? 
            <br /><br />
            Considering almost 2000 years have passed and we live in an even more brutal world than Jesus did, I have to say this is almost as believable as the second coming - an afterthought of Christian followers whose fabrication to explain Jesus’ shortcomings that has still eluded Jewish eyes in the torah to this day.
            <br /><br />
            Most non-Jews today are unfamiliar with other failed messiahs who have made their appearances since Jesus’ death such as Bar Kochba, Sabbatai Zevi, and my personal vote goes to Moses of Crete. It’s safe to assume that these men could be used as an argument for Christianity since their movement’s never caught on, so I became interested in why Christianity did. [2]
            <br /><br />
            I hinted in my last post that Jesus had seen an opening for a revolution against Rome. Israel at the time was a breeding ground of oppression and Jews were being forced to adopt hellenistic practices. Factors that caused made Jews begin to look for the messiah in hopes that he would step in and free his people from the hands of Caesar. 
            <br /><br />
            It’s hard to prove either way what was going on in the minds of Jesus and his disciples, but something worth noting is that after Jesus died his disciples went out from Jerusalem to proselytize. In the New Testament, Jesus supposedly reappears before his ascent back into heaven and commands his followers to “go out and make disciples of all nations”. 
            <br /><br />
            In other words, the Jews weren’t falling for it so Jesus came back to give what could be the world’s first marketing lecture to the early Christians. Facing opposition in Jerusalem and Israel they opted for areas that hadn’t even heard of monotheism and converted uneducated people by the dozens. Once again, nothing has changed in almost 2000 years. 
            <br /><br />
            I’d like to comment more on what I believe to be the character of the One who has really carried the Jews on His back the whole way through times like Roman oppression, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Holocaust. 
            <br /><br />
            Unlike us Jews who have been known to waver between faith and disbelief, God isn’t the type that changes his mind. We have the advantage of modern perspective and interpret the cultural context of scripture to determine if it’s kosher with Him to drive to shabbat services or that premarital sex doesn’t always constitute as adultery, and then we reinterpret the interpretations and so on, but when He says He’s One, Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End, it’s understandable that we’ll tell you to go pound salt if you claim to be God. 
            <br /><br />
            Still, we can see today how the modern Christian church has twisted words in order to solidify their beliefs in Jesus that represent a reversion to the paganistic rituals of idolatry and polytheism. Most non-Catholic Christians will cringe at the sound of worshipping Mary even as just an intercessor for prayer, but analyzing the denominations from the outside provides a clearer view that both are partaking in self-declared heresy. 
            <br /><br />
            The Jewish view of God begins with the Jewish belief that can be heard as all Jews daily recite (or are supposed to recite) the Shema, a beautiful prayer of blessings and praise. It also provides my very first encounter with text manipulation that uproots the central idea of Judaism. Here’s the first line of the prayer:
            <br /><br />

            <p style="text-align:center;">
                     <i>דחָֽאֶ הוָהיְ וּניהֵלֹאֱ הוָהיְ לאֵרָשְׂיִ עמַשְׁ</i>
                     <i>She-ma yisrael, adonai eloheinu, adonai echad</i>
                    <i>Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One</i>
            </p>  
            
            <br /><br />
            For those familiar with the Holy Trinity:  Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the first line of the first prayer said first thing in the morning is as far as Christianity could go without its first contradiction. 
            <br /><br />
            How can God be one but also three? The answer lies in the word דחָֽאֶ (echad). 
            <br /><br />
            I have to antagonize the neanderthalic English language for its succinctness and inability to properly express itself, but echad is best translated to <i>one</i> in the sense of absolute unity. A oneness that exists without impurities and would not be echad if it was in more than one place; a compound unity best described by the word דיחִיָ (yachid). If yachid had been used in Deuteronomy in lieu of echad then I believe the trinity could be an arguable stance in the Jewish bible. After all, we do have an equivalent of the holy spirit. [3]
            <br /><br />
            Instead we see a manipulation of echad as opposed to a natural evolution of our understanding of the word. 
            <br /><br />
            The <i>one</i> argument is one of many against the derivative faiths, but my favorite examples of Christian meddling are the verses found in Leviticus, specifically 18:22 and 20:13, that are still used to denounce homosexuality despite the oddly-worded translation. There’s also commentary on the covenant with Israel, the Messianic prophecies, and all of the things that I had questioned prior to my return to the religion. If you’re interested in the linguistics I posted some reference links at the end of the article, but for my purposes, I want to avoid picking apart anymore nuances of a language that I’m still learning. [4]
            <br /><br />
            Let me tell you, it wasn’t easy to completely renounce Jesus and take Pascal’s Wager for a go. My own family seems to be certain of my hellbound future which isn’t the easiest thing to hear. I felt trapped between societal pressure and my own personal convictions so years passed before I took a single step in any direction; it took courage to move towards a parent religion that offers even fewer answers than its offspring. 
            <br /><br />
            I didn’t give much thought to another faith besides that of Atheism, but it didn’t last long. On my recent trip to Chile, I visited the Atacama desert which boasts some of the clearest and most beautiful night skies in the world. It’s stargazing where I try to make the most sense of my being, but fail every time. Even though people attempt to point out evidence that could likely point to a higher being, there exists just as much evidence to the antithesis. I take the optimistic stance and it’s as simple and subjective as that.  
            <br /><br />
            So if He exists, why does he allow so much suffering?
            <br /><br />
            In the conversion class at synagogue, Rabbi Zimmerman presented one of the many rationalizations of this question that I still think on daily and proposed that the character of God can best be described by one of the following:  God is malevolent, God is benevolent, or God is omnipotent. No religious person in their right mind is going to find their answer in a malevolent God, so that leaves an upstanding God or an all-powerful God. We can all agree that if God was both of these things then there wouldn’t be genocide, trafficking, and all of the strife in our world. We’re left deciding between the Deist view of all-powerful God who has obviously left our planet to go tend to one of his other side projects and the Jewish view that there’s a Good Guy around here somewhere but he doesn’t have power over all of the forces with which we’ve been left to reckon. [5]
            <br /><br />
            Similar to the answer for the question of pain, the other age-old questions don’t have a definite answer outside of Judaism. An answer so riveting that it sometimes pushes man to the edge of his sanity. Here it is:
            <br /><br />
            We don’t have the slightest clue.
            <br /><br />
            It’s all speculation.
            <br /><br />
            Paul Hoffman described the great mathematician Paul Erdős’ view of God, “The SF is the Supreme Fascist, the Number-One Guy Up There, God, who is always tormenting Erdős by hiding his glasses, stealing his Hungarian passport, or, worse yet, keeping to Himself the elegant solutions to all sorts of intriguing mathematical problems”. Whether it be mathematical or existential, more is hidden in our universe than revealed. [6]
            <br /><br />
            My favorite thing about Judaism is that when faced with difficult questions, I can speak with my rabbi and fully expect to receive an honest answer of <i>I don’t know</i>. 
            <br /><br />
            I apologize for extrapolating to every one of the thousands of religions in the world, but I’m a believer of the religion that has the Truth. In its most stripped down and fundamental beliefs, Judaism has no freaking idea. 
            <br /><br />
            As one of the commenters on my last post said, “Judaism is by no means intellectually or logically sound but a few millennia of persecution will certainly move your faith/religion in that direction”. We don’t evangelize. Hell, if you come to us asking to join we’ll remind you that it’s not necessary and turn you down a few times until you prove you’re stubborn enough to become one of us. We are the smallest of the Abrahamic faiths because of our non-existent marketing scheme and we honestly should have been wiped out centuries ago. The only logical argument on our end is that there’s someone on the outside pulling the strings of his chosen people because analyzing the statistics of survival will baffle even the likes of Erdős. 
            <br /><br />
            But to give my answer to everyone’s question of why I chose Judaism, I have to come back to the subjectivity of human belief. It wasn’t just re-reading some bible scripture with a new perspective that made everything clearer or investigating other religions to determine if they were something worth following.
            <br /><br />
            It was seeing my grandfather.
            <br /><br />
            A man who I had never met before lit up like a Christmas tree when he saw me, even though I was the part of the family that had fallen off more than 30 years ago. I couldn’t imagine a white, western-European looking Jesus that could’ve looked at me with that kind of intense love. 
            <br /><br />
            It was my first time in synagogue.
            <br /><br />
            Besides the fact that I came in as a former-Christian and discussed my questions there, I was never uncomfortable. Congregation Beth Shalom welcomed me with open arms, affirmed my Jewish identity, and continues to treat me like the valuable Jewish descendant that I am.
            <br /><br />
            It was my time in Israel.
            <br /><br />
            I don’t speak the language well and the hospitality is nonexistent sometimes, but each time I step off the plane in Tel Aviv... I feel like I’m home.
